short-description: Self destructing To-Do
---


To-do lists are notorious for collecting junk: to-do items that you want to remember, but are not very important and thus get consistently put off. To address the problem of to-do list clutter, I created Blocitoff. Accessible anywhere in the world with internet access, Blocitoff is a private To-Do List.

Blocitoff will aim to keep to-do lists manageable by automatically deleting to-do items that have not been completed after seven days. The hypothesis is that if the to-do item is not important enough to be completed in seven days, it doesn't belong on your to-do list.
