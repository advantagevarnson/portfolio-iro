Bloc-Jams is a digital music player, similar to Spotify.

The tag is “A streaming website where one can discover new music.”

It includes a dynamic player bar so the user can change songs regardless of what page they’re currently on.  

After the initial build, I also refactored this using AngularJS to be a S.P.A. (Single Page Application) which has some great benefits as with SPA less server queries are needed, thus increasing the response time of the site.
