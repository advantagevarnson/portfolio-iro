short-description: Regulate you or your employees work schedule!

Bloctime divides typical work day into brackets.

These brackets fall under two different categories, work and break.

This helps regulate work schedules as well as allocated break times.

The work bracket is 30 minutes at a time, followed by a 5 minute break, which is a recommended practice for any individual working at a computer for an extended period of time.

As people need to eat lunch (usually around midday), every fourth 5 minute break becomes a 30 minute break.

It also lets you mark down your tasks for the day, so as to keep you focused on what needs to be achieved.
